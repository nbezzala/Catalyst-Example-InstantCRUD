=head1 NAME

Catalyst::Example::InstantCRUD - A CRUD scaffolding for Catalyst.

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Catalyst::Example::InstantCRUD version 0.0.18

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    instantcrud.pl -name=My::App -dsn='dbi:Pg:dbname=CE' -user=zby -password='pass'

The instantcrud.pl executable creates a skeleton CRUD application in
current directory. The parameters are: name of the application and
database connection details.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The script will create CRUD interface (CReate, Update, Delete) 
with paging and sort for all
tables defined in the accessed database.  
The Create and Update forms let you manipulate also on relations
(even many to many).
It includes some basic authentication code.

I am waiting for suggestions what else basic functionality would be nice
to have in the generated application.

When the code is generated you can run the application:

    $ My-App/script/my_app_server.pl
    You can connect to your server at http://zby.aster.net.pl:3000

To access the CRUD interface to the tables you need to add
'/tablename' (in lowercase) to the address:
http://localhost:3000/tablename 
(Note that if the table name has a underscore, that underscore should be 
deleted in the address so table foo_bar is available at 
http://localhost:3000/foobar, this is due to some conversions made by the 
underlying libraries).

The generated application will use DBIx::Class for model classes and
Template::Toolkit for View.

=head1 CUSTOMISATION AND EXTENDING

The first place for customisations are the Template Toolkit templates
and the CSS file.
The CSS file used by the application is root/static/pagingandsort.css.
The templates are generated in directories named after the controllers in the
root directory.  

To customize the forms used for creation and modification of records you can
modify the interface_config.dat file generated in the application main 
directory.  For now it's content is a dump of a perl structure. I hope it is
enough self explanatory for some simple
modifications.  The most basic one should be deleting some field,
by deleting it's hash from the list, and changing the order of fields.

The generated controller is a subclass of 
Catalyst::Example::Controller::InstantCRUD. 
You can use the standard OO technique of overriding the documented methods
to customize and extend it.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

The main generator script (instantcrud.pl) is an ugly hack.  First
the Catalyst helpers assume where the executable is located so I had
to fool them, second there is no API for creation of the main
application module (My::App).

The generated application shall not work for tables with composite primary keys (other than the link tables for a many to many relatioship).
