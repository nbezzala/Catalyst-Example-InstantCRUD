=head1 NAME

Catalyst::Example::InstantCRUD  


=head1 VERSION

This document describes Catalyst::Example::InstantCRUD version 0.0.4


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    instantcrud.pl -name=My::App -dsn='dbi:Pg:dbname=CE' -user=zby -password='pass'

The instantcrud.pl executable creates a skeleton CRUD application in
current directory. The parameters are: name of the application and
database connection details.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The script will create CRUD interface with paging and sort for all
tables defined in the accessed database.  
When the code is generated you can run the application:

    $ My-App/script/my_app_server.pl
    You can connect to your server at http://zby.aster.net.pl:3000

To access the CRUD interface to the tables you need to add
'/tablename' (in lowercase) to the address:
http://localhost:3000/tablename 
(Note that if the table name has a underscore, that underscore should be 
deleted in the address so table foo_bar is available at 
http://localhost:3000/foobar, this is due to some conversions made by the 
underlying libraries).

The generated application will use DBIx::Class for model classes and
Template::Toolkit for View.

=head1 CUSTOMISATION AND EXTENDING

The first place for customisations are the Template Toolkit templates
and the CSS file.
The CSS file used by the application is root/static/pagingandsort.css.
To customize the templates copy them from the subdirectory templates of the
directory where the Catalyst::Controller::PagingAndSort
was installed to the "root" directory in the generated application and 
modify them.

The generated controller is a subclass of Catalyst::Controller::PagingAndSort. It's edit_columns method returns a hash describing all editable columns, 
the constraints are then used to verify values in submited forms.  It should
be modified to adjust the constraints to local requirements.
You can use the standard OO technique of overriding the documented methods
to customize and extend it.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

The main generator script (instantcrud.pl) is an ugly hack.  First
the Catalyst helpers assume where the executable is located so I had
to fool them, second there is no API for creation of the main
application module (My::App).
